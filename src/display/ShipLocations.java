//This class is designed to be an efficient way for the display
//to query what ship is at a given location.
//Rather than have the display iterate over every single ship
//for every element that it needs to render, query this class.

//The main data structure (shipLocations) is a list of lists
//Each entry in shipLocations corresponds to a row on the board
//Each data element in shipLocations is a list of ships that occupy
//a space in that row.
//Each data element in that data structure contains the info of
//what column it is found in as well as the type of ship that it is

//Time complexity to create the data structure is O(# of ships)
//Space complexity is O(# of points for # of ships) = O(17)
//Time complexity to query is O(# of points for # of ships)
